# This script should download the file specified in the first argument ($1),
# place it in the directory specified in the second argument ($2),
# and *optionally*:
# - uncompress the downloaded file with gunzip if the third
#   argument ($3) contains the word "yes"
# - filter the sequences based on a word contained in their header lines:
#   sequences containing the specified word in their header should be **excluded**




download_file=$1

wget -P $2 $1


gunzip -k  data/*.fastq.gz
mkdir -p data/sec_fastq
mv data/*.fastq data/sec_fastq



if [ "$3" == "yes" ]
then
	gunzip -k $2/$1
fi





#
# Example of the desired filtering:
#
#   > this is my sequence
#   CACTATGGGAGGACATTATAC
#   > this is my second sequence
#   CACTATGGGAGGGAGAGGAGA
#   > this is another sequence
#   CCAGGATTTACAGACTTTAAA
#
#   If $4 == "another" only the **first two sequence** should be output
